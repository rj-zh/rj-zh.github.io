                            <h3>MA thesis project</h3>
                            I'm currently working on my MA thesis project <strong>"Pursuit of Permanent Status and Career 
                            Choices for International Students in Canada"</strong>. This study seeks to understand how 
                            the pursuit of permanent legal status affect international students’ career choices and trajectory. 
                            I will conduct interviews with international student graduates from recognized 
                            postsecondary institutions in Toronto, Ontario. I will draw on general theories concerning 
                            precarious work and intersectionality, and also use my empirical findings to expand existing theoretical 
                            concepts such as status coercion and liminal legality, which are mostly developed within the U.S. 
                            context. The study will contribute to understanding immigrants’ career outcome in Canada by providing new 
                            insights on early career engagement and underemployment.

                            <h3>Research assistantship</h3>
                            I am currently working as research assistant for the project <strong>“Algorithmic and 
                            intersectional? Gender, race, and automation in hiring processes”</strong>. In this project 
                            I work with <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/denier">Dr. Nicole 
                            Denier</a> and <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/khughes">Dr.

                             a novel intersectional and multi-method approach, focusing on Canada. It aims to 
                             study how supply-side (e.g., job seekers, employees) and demand-side (e.g., employers) 
                             actions contribute to intersectional inequalities. <br>

                            <h3>Undergraduate thesis project</h3>In summer 2020 I initiated a Student Research 
                            Training project <strong>“Cost and reward for female beautification practice: Investigation of 
                            eating disorders among Chinese female college students”</strong>, which later turned into my 
                            undergraduate thesis project. I worked on this project for two years, during which I 
                            conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 informants, analyzed the qualitative data, 
                            and wrote several drafts based on two different theoretical frameworks. This project 
                            was conducted under the supervision of 
                            <a href="https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1202/7499.htm">Dr. Tianhan Gui</a>,

                            Winter Meeting. I therefore participated and presented this project in one of the 
                            round table panels, as the only undergraduate student from a Chinese institution 
                            among the round tables.  <br>

                            Between year 2022 and 2023 I worked and lived in London, UK for 10 months. I am quite fond and nostalgic of the whole experience. Also there was this one lager I tasted in Torquay (a small seaside town in Southern England) that greatly improved my overall impression for beer.<br><br>
                            I love musicals and music and theatre in general. In retrospect it seems that I have developed a habit of planning short trips with almost the sole purpose of seeing musicals and plays. I spent two days in Stratford-upon-Avon in England and saw <i>Richard III</i> the play in Shakespeare’s hometown; I went to Vienna twice, for three days and one day respectively, and saw the <i>Rebecca</i> musical as well as the <i>Elisabeth</i> musical concert; in November 2023 I visited New York and Minneapolis in the US to see two Sondheim musicals, <i>Merrily We Roll Along</i> and <i>Company</i>. I also love choral music and I've been singing in choirs for six consecutive years now. It's a simple, pure and beautiful source of consolation and joy.<br><br>
                            I enjoy literary reading and writing immensely. During my undergrad study I took a minor degree in English language & literature, just so that I could spend more time reading literary works in a fully justified manner. <br><br>
                            I enjoy gaming but only to a very limited extent. If you invite me to play overcooked or minecraft together I would always say yes.<br><br>
                            I'm slowly learning Polish and I have a small wooden beaver on my nightstand.<br><br>
                            I somehow like front-end web development but find it really hard to keep as a hobby. I built this website by myself. <br><br>

                            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
