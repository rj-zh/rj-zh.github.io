                            <h2>2024—2025 | MA thesis project</h2>

                            My MA thesis project, <strong>"Pursuit of Permanent Status and Career 
                            Choices for International Students in Canada"</strong>, seeks to understand how 
                            the pursuit of permanent legal status affect international students’ career choices and trajectory. 
                            My study builds on existing research on immigrant insecure legal status and school-to-work 
                            transitions and is guided by theories of precarious work. To collect empirical data, 
                            I conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 international student graduates 
                            from Canadian universities who had experiences using post-graduation work permit (PGWP) to work in Canada and intended 
                            to gain permanent legal status. <br>
                            My findings reveal that PGWP holders frequently engage in trade-offs to strategically 
                            prioritize their immigration goals. These trade-offs involve but are not limited to 
                            career decisions, education plans, and taking on more uncertainties regarding their future. 
                            Additionally, PGWP holders face obstacles at various stages of their labour market experiences 
                            due to the temporary nature of their status, and lack institutional support and sufficient 
                            information as they navigate their own status and when they go through the process 
                            of applying for permanent residency. 
                            My research has yielded valuable insight into international students’ experiences with the PGWP. 
                            It shows that, even though the PGWP greatly enables the formation of people’s immigration 
                            intention to Canada, the prospect of having an open work permit for up to three years 
                            does not always play out as ideally as hoped, and the PGWP policy does not give 
                            international student graduates a direct and smooth pathway to gaining permanence in Canada.

                            <h2>2023—ongoing | Research assistantship</h2>

                            I am currently working as a research assistant for the project <strong>“Algorithmic and 
                            intersectional? Gender, race, and automation in hiring processes”</strong>, mainly under 
                            the supervision of <a href="https://www.colby.edu/people/people-directory/nicole-denier/">Dr. Nicole Denier</a>. 
                            This project examines algorithmic labour markets through
                            a novel intersectional and multi-method approach, focusing on Canada. It aims to 
                            study how supply-side (e.g., job seekers, employees) and demand-side (e.g., employers) 
                            actions contribute to intersectional inequalities. <br>

                            <h2>2020—2022 | Undergraduate thesis project</h2>In summer 2020 I initiated a Student Research 
                            Training project <strong>“Cost and reward for female beautification practice: Investigation of 
                            eating disorders among Chinese female college students”</strong>, which later turned into my 
                            undergraduate thesis project. I worked on this project for two years, during which I 
                            conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 informants, analyzed the qualitative data, 
                            and wrote several drafts based on two different theoretical frameworks. This project 
                            was conducted under the supervision of 
                            <a href="https://www.sppm.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1022/7431.htm">Dr. Tianhan Gui</a>. An abstract of 
                            this research project was accepted by SWS (Sociologists for Women in Society) 2021 
                            Winter Meeting. I therefore participated and presented this project in one of the 
                            round table panels, as the only undergraduate student from a Chinese institution 
                            among the round tables.  <br>

                            I love musicals and music and theatre in general. In retrospect it seems that I have developed a habit of planning short trips with almost the sole purpose of seeing musicals and plays. I spent two days in Stratford-upon-Avon in England and saw <i>Richard III</i> the play in Shakespeare’s hometown; I went to Vienna twice, for three days and one day respectively, and saw the <i>Rebecca</i> musical as well as the <i>Elisabeth</i> musical concert; in August 2023 I visited London for one night to see <i>Next to Normal</i> in theatre; in November 2023 I visited New York and Minneapolis in the US to see two Sondheim musicals, <i>Merrily We Roll Along</i> and <i>Company</i>. I also love choral music and I've been singing in choirs for seven consecutive years now. It's a simple, pure and beautiful source of consolation and joy.<br><br>
                            I enjoy literary reading and writing immensely. During my undergrad study I took a minor degree in English language & literature, just so that I could spend more time reading literary works in a fully justified manner. <br><br>
                            I enjoy gaming selectively, and I have a limited but growing list of games that I find enjoyable. Some items on the list: overcooked; bananagrams; minecraft; it takes two.<br><br>
                            I'm slowly learning Polish (Duolingo Polish course graduate!) and I have a small wooden beaver on my bookshelf.<br><br>
                            I like front-end web development but find it really hard to keep as a hobby. I built this website by myself. <br><br>

                            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
